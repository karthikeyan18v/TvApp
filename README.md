# TvApp
This project is a basic Android TV-compatible app built using Kotlin and ExoPlayer. It displays a grid of video content (streaming URLs or local assets) and allows users to play them in full-screen mode. The app supports D-pad navigation, remote control actions, and is optimized for Android TV.
